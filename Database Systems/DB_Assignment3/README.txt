This assignment was for a website that simulates a hospital's 
patient scheduling site.  A user can log on as either a doctor
or a patient, and access specific functions depending on which 
one they are.  

The front end uses microsoft's asp.net format, and is supported 
by a relational database, which can be accessed in the App_Data 
folder.  The entire project is intended for use in visual studio.
